The rules of the pension or provident fund set out in detail the various options available to a member on termination of membership. The summary below is intended only to give a member an overview of the various benefits and options to which the member may be entitled so that the member can make an informed choice with regard to the benefits. We strongly recommend that money accumulated for retirement should be preserved whenever possible. Experience shows that once money allocated for retirement is taken in the form of cash, it is very rarely replaced at a later stage. The following options are generally available: </span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Cash Benefit :</b> <span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>Taking the benefit in cash The implications of taking a cash benefit on withdrawal are that the tax-free amount (currently, R25 000, per life time, plus the member’s own contributions not previously allowed as a deduction) has been exceeded, the remaining benefit will be subject to tax. Clearly, a cash payment means that money set aside for retirement may be used for other purposes, resulting in the member having insufficient funds to live on after retirement. Lump sum withdrawals due to the member being retrenched or made redundant (voluntary or involuntary) are taxed in the same manner as a retirement claim (currently, R500 000, per life time, plus the member’s own contributions not previously allowed as a deduction). However, this tax relief is not available to a taxpayer who was, at any time, a director of the employer company and at the time held more than 5% of the issued share capital or member’s interest in that company. <br /></span></div><div><span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}><br /></span></div><div><b><span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '13.3333px' }}>Transfer your Benefit:</span></b><span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '13.3333px' }}> </span><span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>Transferring the benefit to a fund operated by the member’s new employer It is usually possible to transfer the benefit to a fund operated by the member’s new employer. Not only will such a transfer be free of tax (unless it is a pension to provident fund transfer) but the benefit will be held to the member’s credit under the member’s new employer’s fund. Here it will earn investment income until such time the member retires or leaves the new fund. Please note, if transferring to another fund/participating employer administered by Liberty Corporate and individual member choice is allowed, the member must complete a new investment portfolio selection form. </span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Transfer Benefit to Retirement Annuity:&nbsp;</b> <span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>Transferring the benefit to a retirement annuity or preservation plan This option is similar to transferring the benefit to a fund operated by the member’s new employer described above, with the difference being that the money is held in the member’s own individual investment plan. In the case of a retirement annuity, up to one-third of the final amount accumulated can be taken at retirement in the form of cash, subject to tax at that time. The balance of the proceeds must be taken in the form of a pension that will be subject to tax. Note that the earliest age at which the member may retire from a retirement annuity is 55. The difference between a preservation plan and a retirement annuity is that one withdrawal may be made from a preservation plan prior to retirement (depending on accessibility) to meet any unexpected financial needs. </span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Continuation Option:&nbsp;</b><span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>Death and disability benefit continuation option Where this is offered, a member who has been on the fund for more than 12 months may, within 60 days of leaving service, exercise an option to take out an individual policy without evidence of health. However, a Cotinine test may be required to confirm smoker status. In this way the member can continue valuable life cover (and disability cover where applicable), at his/her own expense. </span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Preservation:</b> <span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>Preserving the benefit within the fund When members leave their employer from 1 March 2019, they have the option to preserve their benefits within the fund. On this option, no cash payment will be made to a member on withdrawal. Instead, their accumulated withdrawal and retirement savings will continue to be invested inside the fund. Members of the Liberty Corporate Selection Umbrella Funds will be required to choose their investment portfolio(s) into which their preservation benefits will be invested. This is done by completing preservation section  of this form. If no selection is made, then the member's preservation benefit will be placed in one of the Default Investment Portfolios selected by the Trustees of the Liberty Corporate Selection Umbrella Funds. The member can choose to change this investment portfolio selection at a future date by completing an investment switch form. For members of other retirement funds, the underlying investment portfolio will be the same investment portfolio that the member was invested in before becoming a preserved member, or as guided by the Rules of the Fund. Whilst being a Deferred Retiree or Preserver Member in the Fund, the member will continue to have access to investment portfolios at institutional rates. Depending on the investment portfolio selection, these rates are typically lower than that of a preservation offering outside the Fund. When the member reaches retirement, the member can ask for the Preserver Benefit to be paid out according to prevailing legislation and relevant pay-out options at that time. </span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Fees:</b> <span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>The Fund charges an administration fee of R30 per month for administering your benefit. The fee is automatically deducted
from your fund benefit on a monthly basis and is reviewed annually. The administration fee is separate and in addition to
investment portfolio fees. The current fee will be reflected on your In Fund Preservation Member Investment Statement (IFP
MIS). Investment management fees are calculated and charged on a daily basis on each portfolio you are invested in. In
addition to the administration fee, the Fund also charges a Governance levy and FSCA levy, both of which are calculated in
terms of current legislation.

If the member is retiring from a pension fund, up to one-third of the full benefit may be taken as a cash lump sum, and the balance will have to be taken in the form of a monthly pension (annuity). The member will receive a portion of the lump sum commutation free of tax provided that the member has not previously taken a lump sum – refer to latest tax tables.</span></span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Taking a portion of the retirement benefit as a monthly pension (annuity):&nbsp;</b><span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>On retiring from a provident or pension fund, the member may choose to take all or part of their retirement benefit as a monthly pension (annuity). </span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>There are two ways of doing this:<br /></span></div><div><br /></div><div><span className="size" style={{ fontSize: '10.6667px' }}>Purchasing a voluntary purchase annuity from a registered Insurer.

This election is only available once the member has reached normal retirement age. This means that the retirement will no longer be deemed to accrue when the member retires from his/ her employer. The date of accrual of the retirement benefit (used for tax purposes) will be the date that the member to receive his/her retirement benefit. We will update the fund records accordingly. Should the member wish to defer receipt of their retirement benefit they need to complete the Retirement Deferral Form. Members who would like to defer their retirement should notify Liberty Corporate timeously of any changes to their contact information.
